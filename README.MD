Assignment #3 for CSCI E-20, HES Fall 2015

Part 1: Basic jQuery requirements (75 points):

[X] Create all of the jQuery/JavaScript below in a single, external file, linked to your website as demonstrated in lecture.
[X] Build a form for your website with at least two jQuery-driven interactive elements. The form does not need to submit.
[X] Add at least one click effect to your site. When clicked, at least two actions should occur. This click effect cannot happen on the form page but may happen on any other page.
[X] Add at least one hover effect to your site. When the element is hovered over, at least two actions should occur. The page should restore itself to its previous look/behavior when the mouse rolls off the element. This hover effect cannot happen on the form page but may happen on any other page. You may have more than one click or hover event for your pages. You may have additional click and/or hover events on your form. But at least one click and at least one hover event must occur on a page that is not your form.
[X] Add at least one effect that is tied to an if/else choice. You may combine this with any of the other items here on the page. For example, the if/else occurs in your form with one of the two interactive elements required for the form.
[X] Add at least one effect that requires filtering the results (odd/even, first/last, etc.). You may combine this with any of the other items here on the page. For example, the filtering occurs in your click effect along with the two actions.
[X] Add two more effects of your choice to the page. These can occur when the page loads, via click, via hover, or via one of the other events in jQuery.
[] HTML and CSS should pass validation as much as possible. This will also keep your jQuery executing correctly.

Part 2: jCanvas requirements (25 points):

The below requirements are specific to this portion of the assignment and cannot be combined with Part 1 requirements. These elements can co-exist on the page, but don’t count requirements from Part 1 in Part 2.

Example: do not count the button requirement below as an example of a click behavior from part 1.
Acceptable: Your canvas element is on one of your web pages that ALSO displays some of the part 1 requirements.
You may include all of your code for this portion of the assignment in the SAME external jQuery/JavaScript file as part 1. You may also make a separate jQuery/JavaScript file for part 2 if you wish. Either way is fine.
Please do not simply follow along with the lecture and turn this code in as your own. I have provided all code for you with the lectures, so by doing this, you have not demonstrated mastery of anything. For example, you turn in a meme generator with different photos – this would not demonstrate mastery of the week’s lecture. Please come up with something new for canvas.

Create a page that makes use of the canvas tag. You should be working with jQuery and jCanvas as part of this process:

[] A button that, when clicked, clears the entire canvas or part of the canvas.
[] At least two different elements drawn on the canvas when a button is clicked. For example, circles and rectangles are drawn on the canvas together when the button is clicked.
[] Demonstrate chaining together jCanvas methods. For example, in the lecture, three circles were drawn to the page via chaining. There was a form element where we assigned the value of the element to a variable and converted the input to all uppercase letters via chaining.
[] As shown in the lecture, create a form element on the page that accepts some kind of user input. Bring that input into jQuery/jCanvas and have the canvas react to the user input. For example, in the lecture, the canvas displayed the text that that user entered. The background photo changed as the select dropdown option changed.
You may combine these Part 2 requirements as you wish within Part 2. For example, points 2-4 were all executed when the meme generator button was clicked. Do not combine these requirements with Part 1 requirements.
