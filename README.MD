# Part 1: jQuery Mobile (67% of grade)

Create a 2-3 page website using jQuery Mobile. Use the jQuery Mobile definition of "page" for the page count, not the number of HTML documents.

>Create the site using jQuery Mobile pages or dialogs.  (Hint: this means there will be one single HTML page, but the navigation will make it seem like 2-3 pages.)

> Use the grid system and make something responsive with custom code (not the built-in breakpoint). Use at least one breakpoint, as defined in a media query. (You may code more if you wish.) This must be applied to at least one of the pages on your site.

* [X] Include at least one button or icon (or both).

* [X] From the jQuery Mobile demo page (http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/), make use of at least 2 items that end in “widget”. Example: listview widget, navbar widget, popup widget, etc. Not all of these were covered in class. You should be able to read the docs and implement these.

* [X] Create a custom theme for your site using ThemeRoller and make use of it in your site. (You can apply the theme to the whole page or a few elements on your page – your pick.) You should have at least one main theme (i.e. a "c" theme), but if you want to add additional styling elements to more themes (like a "d" or "e" theme), you are welcome to do so.

* [X] Create a form for your site that contains at least 4 distinct field types. (Example: a group of radio buttons, a text field, a select list, etc.) The form does not have to submit. Use proper HTML5 coding and field types for creating the form, as covered in previous lectures. For at least two of the field types, include a jQuery Mobile modification, as demonstrated in the lecture (horizontal display, mini version, etc) or some other modification you find in the documentation.

* [X] Apply at least two of the jQuery Mobile touch events to your page(s) to make something happen. jQuery Mobile events are listed at http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/ (Links to an external site.) Some were covered in lecture, and you may use these, or you may use other events listed in the docs.

# Part 2: jQuery UI (33% of grade) -- added November 30

Create a separate document or documents using jQuery UI and demonstrating the requirements below. This can be part of your jQuery Mobile site, or it can stand alone as a separate URL.

> You may combine jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI on the same page. However, as noted in the lecture, this may be buggy, so it is recommended that you have a separate jQuery UI document(s) demonstrating the below features.

> You do not have to create a custom jQuery UI download. You may use the default with all of the options.

* Create a custom jQuery UI ThemeRoller theme. This may compliment the jQuery Mobile theme, or it may be totally different.

> Include in the page(s) the following. Interaction/widget/effect groups are taken from the jQuery UI website:

1. [X] ONE INTERACTION: Draggable, droppable, resizeable, selectable, sortable. You may use more than one interaction in your site.

2. [X] ONE WIDGET. You may NOT use: Buttons (and other form elements listed under Buttons), Datepicker, Tooltip. You may use more than one widget in your site. 

3. [X] ONE EFFECT. You may NOT use: Add class, remove class, show, hide. I recommend investigating Toggle but you may choose any of the other remaining effects. You may use more than one effect in your site. 

4. [X] FOR EACH INTERACTION/WIDGET/EFFECT: you will create something new, not demonstrated on the demo page. I want you to do what I did in the video. Using the tooltip, I combined "custom animation" with "track the mouse". It looked ugly, but it was not code that I copied and pasted in whole from the website either. I am looking for a demonstration of understanding that you can read the documentation and write good quality jQuery to form your own interactions/widgets/effects on your site. You should combine at least two aspects in each example. You are welcome to combine more.

> NO CREDIT GIVEN FOR: Copying/pasting the examples into your work without manipulation, or with only CSS manipulation. Watching the lynda.com videos and using their examples in your homework.
